shk-linux-conf -- synchronise you configuration files via a git repository


INSTALL FROM A REPOSITORY


Default repository is mine.
It can be changed in the script or via script options -u and -r.

$ wget --no-check-certificate -qO- https://raw.github.com/leonnib4/linux_conf/master/shk-linux-conf | bash
- or -
$ curl -s https://raw.github.com/leonnib4/linux_conf/master/shk-linux-conf | bash

---
Note that some operations will require root permissions because user cannot write to /etc/ and so on.

CREATE YOUR OWN REPOSITORY


You can put your files anywhere you want, script goes recursively.
The files you want to propose as an update MUST have a valid TAG:

Regex: ^.+ .*filename r[0-9]+$
Example: # /etc/php/php.ini r0
         ;; ~/.emacs r42

First part can be anything.
Second part is a path, that can be absolute or start from home: use ~.
Last part tags the release of the file.

---
It is important that you remember to increment the release count everytime you change the file on the repo, so that the script utilised remotely can detect that the tag has changed and start updating.
